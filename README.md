# Movies-ticketing-website
This website offers various functions. For instance, visitors can view theater information, such as the locations of each branch, movie promotions and news, movie schedules, and membership registration. Members have the ability to reserve seats online, make payments through the website, and receive e-tickets. Upon entry to the theater, patrons can show a screenshot of the e-ticket to the theater staff.

This project needs to run with phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench. The database contains a table that includes information about theater memberships. There are four columns in the table: username, email, phone, and ps (password).

In order to make the website work, you need to place all the files in your xampp/htdocs folder before running it!
